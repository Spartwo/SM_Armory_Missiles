	description = The Mark 32-1 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes (Mk 32-1 SVTT) system is a torpedo launching system designed for the Kerbin States Navy. The Mark 32 has been the standard anti-submarine torpedo launching system aboard Kerbin States Navy surface vessels since its introduction  To enable the turret, select the mounted missile from the weapon manager.USER MANUAL NOTE it is the responsibilty of the operator to ensure that system operates reliably. Skilled operators claim this device has a hit probability of 90% and reliabilty being faultless. Please ensure that any ordanance loaded fits comfortably within the launcher. Failure to observe this warning will likely result in vessel destruction. Operation by untrained operators renders warranty void on first fire. Please observe the safety instructions in the latest microfont low observability ink.
