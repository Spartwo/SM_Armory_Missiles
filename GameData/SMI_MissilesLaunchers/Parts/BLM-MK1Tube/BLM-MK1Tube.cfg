	description = Long Range Ballistic Missile Launch Tube it has one missile node only. It was designed to fire the largest SMI missiles only. There are better launchers for small missiles.  USER MANUAL NOTE it is the responsibilty of the operator to ensure that system operates reliably. Please ensure that any ordanance loaded fits comfortably within the launcher. Do not surface attach missiles use only end node attachment.  Failure to observe this warning will likely result in vessel destruction. Operation by untrained operators renders warranty void on first fire. Please observe the safety instructions in the latest microfont low observability ink.
